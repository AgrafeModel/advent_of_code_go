# Advent of Code - Go

This are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles written in Go.


## Usage

You can run the puzzle using the flags.
Use `go run main.go -h` to see those flags.

```bash
-d int
        Day of the puzzle to run (1-25) (default 0)
-p int
        Part of the puzzle to run (1-2) (default 0)
-y int
        Year of the puzzle to run (2023-2025) (default 0)
```
